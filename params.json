{"name":"Comete","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Comete\r\n\r\nComete is a hobby project developed by Alexander Nilsen. Comete enables the user to use their\r\nAndroid devices to control FlightGear or MSFS over wireless network with the use of built-in\r\naccelerometer sensors, or using as a instrument panel with often used gauges. Comete supersedes Comete for FlightGear and Alni FlightGear Control.\r\n\r\n\r\n* This project requires HoloEverywhere\r\n\r\n### About Regular Comete\r\nThe regular Comete enables the user to control FlightGear or MSFS/P3D over the local network with the accelerometer of the Android device.\r\n\r\nThe use can stear the craft, use the throttle, gears and brakes. The user can even set the COMM, NAV and transponder frequencies of the craft.\r\n\r\nRegular Comete also includes basic information about the heading and velocity of the craft.\r\n\r\n### About Comete Gauges\r\nComete Gauges does not provide the user to control the simulator as the regular Comete does. But does hovever provide the user a way to connect their Android tablets to FlightGear or MSFS/P3D and use it as a instrument panel with gauges for attitude, airspeed, vertical speed, heading and altitude.\r\n\r\n> The graphics for the instruments are taken from the FlightGear project and adapted for use with Comete Gauges.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
